# Contact Card Template using ReactJS

\* created using `create-react-app`

# Introduction

In this repository I made a simple Web Application using ReactJS,that is a contact card template.

You can visit the deployed app, at [Contact Card Template](https://slow-codex.github.io/react-click-counter/).

This repository contains the files related to the app. The `master` branch contains the app's source code (the code the app's developers edit), and the `gh-pages` branch contains a *built* version of the app (i.e. the code that GitHub Pages serves to the app's visitors).

If you want to edit this template for your own use please read below carefully.

## Procedure

1. Download the given code as a zip or the full main branch.

2. Downloading and Installing any Code Editor for a simple edit of the database:

| **Code Editor** | **Link** 	|
|-	|-	|
| Visual Studio Code 	| [Download it from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)	|
| Sublime Text 3 	| [Download it from here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) |
| Atom 	| [Download it from here](https://atom.io/)	|


3. Go to Database Folder in the given code and open contactData.js file in the code editor.

4. Just edit the informations of the contacts accordingly inide the curly braces. By just updating ur database u can get ur edited contact card web page as u prefer.

5. If you face any problem in deploying your edited contact card webpage refer to my procedure tutorial [React Hosting Tutorial using GitHub pages](https://github.com/slow-codex/react-click-counter)

# Notes

* I created this React app using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). By default, apps created using `create-react-app` have a README.md file that looks like [this](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Indeed, the README.md file you're now reading originally looked like that. I have since changed it to look the way it looks today.
* Special thanks to GitHub, Inc., for providing us with the GitHub Pages hosting functionality at no extra charge.
* And now, time to turn the default `create-react-app` app into something unique!
