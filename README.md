# Deploying My First React App* to GitHub Pages

\* created using `create-react-app`

# Introduction

In this repository I made a simple Web Application using ReactJS,that is counting the number of clicks on a button.

You can visit the deployed app, at [https://slowcodex.github.io/react-click-counter/](https://slow-codex.github.io/react-click-counter/).

This repository contains the files related to the app. The `master` branch contains the app's source code (the code the app's developers edit), and the `gh-pages` branch contains a *built* version of the app (i.e. the code that GitHub Pages serves to the app's visitors).

# Notes

* I created this React app using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). By default, apps created using `create-react-app` have a README.md file that looks like [this](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md). Indeed, the README.md file you're now reading originally looked like that. I have since changed it to look the way it looks today.
* Special thanks to GitHub, Inc., for providing us with the GitHub Pages hosting functionality at no extra charge.
* And now, time to turn the default `create-react-app` app into something unique!
